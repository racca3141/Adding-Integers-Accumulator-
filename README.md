# Adding-Integers-Accumulator-

The sum of n integers app.

1. Ask the user how many integers to add.  (Use a for loop when coding this.)
2. Add the integers starting at 1...

1+2+3+4+5 = 15

3. Display the result to the user.
4. Ask if they would like to run again.
5. Modify this app... ask the user what integer to start from.  For example, if the user wants to start from 5, start adding from there.

5+6+7+8 = 26

No functions needed here, do all the work in the main.
